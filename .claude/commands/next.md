# CFS Tracker - Next Task Guidance

Look at `docs/PROGRESS.md` and find the next TODO feature. Then provide detailed implementation guidance:

1. **Feature Name**: What we're building
2. **Why It Matters**: How it fits into the app
3. **Files to Create/Modify**: List specific files
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed implementation steps
5. **How to Test**: Verification steps
6. **Definition of Done**: When to mark it complete

Also check:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how this feature fits the system
- `docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md` if external setup is needed first

Be specific and actionable. A junior developer should be able to follow these instructions without additional context.
