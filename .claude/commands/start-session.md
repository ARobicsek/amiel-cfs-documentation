# CFS Tracker - Start Development Session

You are starting a development session on the CFS Daily Tracker app. Follow these steps:

## 0. Script Reference

**When you need to find or modify code, first read `docs/scriptReferences.md`.**
This file lists every script with its purpose and a direct file link, organized by category (API, utils, components, etc.).

## 1. Check Current Status

Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` and summarize:
- What features are DONE
- What feature is next (first TODO item)
- Any blockers noted

## 2. Verify Environment

Check that the dev can run the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

If there are errors, help resolve them before continuing.

## 3. Identify Today's Goal

Based on the PROGRESS.md, clearly state:
- **Today's Feature**: [Feature name and number]
- **Files to modify**: [List specific files]
- **Prerequisites**: [Any setup needed first, e.g., Google Cloud]

## 4. Create Work Plan

Break down the feature into small, testable steps. For example:
1. Step 1 - [description] - test by [how to verify]
2. Step 2 - [description] - test by [how to verify]
3. etc.

## 5. Confirm Understanding

Ask the developer:
> "We'll be working on [Feature X]. The goal is [description]. Does this make sense? Any questions before we start?"

## Session Rules

Remind the developer:
- Commit after each working step
- Test in browser after each change
- Ask questions if anything is unclear
- We'll update PROGRESS.md at the end of the session

Now proceed with steps 1-5 above.
