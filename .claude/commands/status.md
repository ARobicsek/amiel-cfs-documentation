# CFS Tracker - Project Status

Read the progress tracking file and give me a summary of:

1. **Current Phase**: Which phase are we in?
2. **Completed Features**: What's done?
3. **In Progress**: What's being worked on?
4. **Next Up**: What's the next feature to implement?
5. **Blockers**: Any external setup needed before continuing?

Format the response as a clear status report that's easy to scan.
