## Completed Features Log

### 2025-12-18 - Authentication & Configuration Fixes (Session 9)

## Next Up

**Feature #19: GitHub Repository Setup**
- Initialize proper remote repository
- Push local code to GitHub
- Connect Vercel to GitHub for automatic deployments

**Feature #16: ECG Integration** - Photo upload for ECG tracking (Deferred to after GitHub setup)

Phase 2 notifications are now complete! Moving to Phase 3 polish features.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Design UI for ECG photo upload
2. Add photo capture/upload in DailyEntry component
3. Store photos in cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Cloudinary, or similar)
4. Display ECG photos in entry history
5. Add delete functionality for photos

**Prerequisites**:
- Need to choose cloud storage solution
- May need additional Google Cloud permissions for Drive API

## Blockers / Notes

- **Authentication & Configuration**: **RESOLVED** - Fixed whitespace handling in both Auth Token and Sheet ID.
- **Vercel Cron Job Limitation**: Vercel Hobby plan only allows ONCE PER DAY cron jobs, not every 15 minutes. The app has been updated to use a single daily trigger at 9 PM ET. For more frequent reminders, need to upgrade to Vercel Pro plan or use external cron service (e.g., EasyCron).
- **Notification Action Buttons**: Snooze button may not be visible in all browser/OS combinations. Chrome on Windows may not display notification action buttons depending on system settings. This is a browser/OS limitation, not a code issue. Alternative: Add snooze option in app UI as fallback.
- **PWA Icons**: Currently placeholders - need to generate real 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons
- **Local Development**: Use `vercel dev` to run both frontend and API functions locally (not `npm run dev`)
- **Windows Notifications**: Users must enable Chrome/browser notifications in Windows Settings → System → Notifications for push notifications to display
