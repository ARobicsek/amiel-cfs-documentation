## Next Up

**Testing & Verification** (Priority for Next Session)
- Test timestamp fix: Verify entries show Eastern Time (8:XX PM not 1:XX AM)
- Test pending entries fix: Verify entries save directly without going to pending
- Test manual retry: Verify clicking pending count successfully syncs entries
- Test Google Apps Script: Verify notifications send every 5 minutes (change to 15 min after testing)
- Consider connecting Vercel to GitHub for automatic deployments

**Feature #16: ECG Integration** - Photo upload for ECG tracking

Phase 2 notifications are now complete! Moving to Phase 3 polish features.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Design UI for ECG photo upload
2. Add photo capture/upload in DailyEntry component
3. Store photos in cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Cloudinary, or similar)
4. Display ECG photos in entry history
5. Add delete functionality for photos

**Prerequisites**:
- Need to choose cloud storage solution
- May need additional Google Cloud permissions for Drive API

## Blockers / Notes

- **Authentication & Configuration**: **RESOLVED** - Fixed whitespace handling in both Auth Token and Sheet ID.
- **Pending Entries Issue**: **RESOLVED** - Fixed auth token trimming, added visible error feedback, and manual retry button. Users can now see and resolve sync failures.
- **Vercel Cron Job Limitation**: **RESOLVED** - Replaced with Google Apps Script triggering endpoint every 5 minutes (adjustable to 15 min). Free solution using existing Google infrastructure, no Vercel Pro upgrade needed.
- **Production API URL**: **RESOLVED** - Created .env.production file to ensure relative URLs in production builds.
- **Notification Action Buttons**: Snooze button may not be visible in all browser/OS combinations. Chrome on Windows may not display notification action buttons depending on system settings. This is a browser/OS limitation, not a code issue. Alternative: Add snooze option in app UI as fallback.
- **PWA Icons**: Currently placeholders - need to generate real 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons
- **Local Development**: Use `vercel dev` to run both frontend and API functions locally (not `npm run dev`)
- **Windows Notifications**: Users must enable Chrome/browser notifications in Windows Settings → System → Notifications for push notifications to display
- **Google Apps Script Trigger**: Currently set to 5 minutes for testing. Change to 15 minutes after verification.
